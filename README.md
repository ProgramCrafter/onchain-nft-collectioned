# Purpose

TON NFTs support storing images either onchain or offchain. Storing data outside of the blockchain can create availability issues, so I've created this tool to allow easily switching to onchain storage.

[Past version](https://gist.github.com/ProgramCrafter/704886244271f004319951a5e8eaa241), with which I minted [Frozen NFTs](https://getgems.io/nft/EQB2NJFK0H5OxJTgyQbej0fy5zuicZAXk2vFZEDrqbQ_n5YW), required user to send a transaction for deployment of each NFT separately and didn't group NFTs in collections, and that made proving their integrity (or, on other hand, being minted by someone other) harder.

This one was used to deploy [collection "No differences split us"](https://getgems.io/collection/EQAYHQhKwLtu0zzM7xAjA_Pfypz1tt2VR9goSyTRSvYb9Zm3). Collection doesn't support reporting royalty but otherwise NFTs are totally functional.
